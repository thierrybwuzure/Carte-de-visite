# Digital Business Card - Thierry Bwuzure

Hey there! Welcome to my digital business card project! 🚀

## What's This All About?

This is basically my digital version of a business card - but way cooler! It's a simple, clean website that showcases who I am as a frontend developer and what I'm all about. Think of it as my online calling card that I can share with potential employers, collaborators, or anyone curious about my work.

## What You'll Find Here

This little web portfolio includes:

- **🏠 Home Page (index.html)**: My intro page with a friendly bio and links to everything else
- **💪 Skills Page**: All the techy stuff I know and love working with
- **🎯 Interests Page**: What I'm passionate about outside of coding
- **📧 Contact Page**: A simple form to get in touch with me

## The Story Behind It

I'm currently studying frontend development at EFP (that's a school in Belgium, pretty cool place!), and I built this as part of my journey to become a solid frontend developer. I'm actively looking for an internship to put all this learning into practice.

## Tech Stack (Keep It Simple!)

Nothing fancy here, just good old:

- **HTML5** for structure
- **CSS3** for styling
- **Font Awesome** for those neat little icons
- Pure vanilla web technologies - sometimes simple is best!

## How to Check It Out

Just open `index.html` in your browser and you're good to go! No fancy setup required, no dependencies to install. It's designed to work right out of the box.

## Fun Fact

The folder is called "Carte de visite" which is French for "business card" 🇫🇷🇬🇧

## Get in Touch

If you like what you see or have any feedback, don't hesitate to reach out! You can find all my contact info on the contact page, or check out my GitHub and LinkedIn profiles linked in the footer.

Thanks for stopping by!
